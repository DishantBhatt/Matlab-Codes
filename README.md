# Matlab-Codes
Various matlab codes I have written for Numerical Analysis and Computing


These are a collection of functions, code, scripts etc I have written for my Numerical Analysis and Computing class. These scripts implement
numerical methods and produce graphs, estimations, and other useful data. This data was used to obtain approximations, analyze numerical
method efficiency, and analyze error behavior.

Numerical methods implemented for:

Integrals

Linear Algebra

Machine Precision

Calculus Concepts

Note: Some of this code is based off my professorâ€™s resources/code. This code is also not well documented because it was not a requirment for the class. I passed this class with a B and I am confident most of these scripts work and produce correct results.
