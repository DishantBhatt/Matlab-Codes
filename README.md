# Matlab-Codes
Various matlab codes I have written for Numerical Analysis and Computing


These are a collection of functions, code, scripts etc I have written for my Numerical Analysis and Computing class. These scripts implement
numerical methods and produce graphs, estimations, and other useful data. This data was used to obtain approximations, analyze numerical
method efficiency, and analyze error behavior.

Numerical methods implemented for:
Integrals
Linear Algebra
Machine Precision 
Calculus Concepts

Note: Some of this code is based off my professorâ€™s resources/code.
